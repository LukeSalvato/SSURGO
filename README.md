# SSURGO
 
Here is some example code using the FedData package for accessing SSURGO data directly from the internet, processing it with depth weighted averages for all horizons in the top 30cm, mapping those values back across the map unit (MUKEY), and then calculating field level area weighted averages for these soil properties using a soil boundary data set.  
  
 
I also included some example code of map figures using this data
